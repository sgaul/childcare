        <h2>Early childhood care and education indicators</h2>
<p>This review combines two indicators related to childcare, pre-K experience and school readiness that did well in the survey: </p>

<ul>
<li>% 3-4 yr. olds in Head Start or other pre-school</li>
<li>Subsidized childcare slots/1,000 children age 3-5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data and limitations</h2>

<p>Data on early care and education is available from two primary sources. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Census provides data on school enrollment through the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS data is grouped by <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_5YR_B14003&amp;prodType=table">age, race, type and level of school</a>, but is only available for small geographies over a rolling 3 to 5 year period.</li>
<li>The State Department of Education (SDE) provides data on pre-K experience and enrollment, along with data publicly-funded pre-K slots and data on kindergarten-readiness from the kindergarten inventory (KEI). </li>
</ul>

<p>One question is the extent to which these sources ask different questions and tell different stories about pre-K experience for this region. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Services (DSS) also provides data on subsidies, such as Care4Kids, that are targeted at early childhood. </p>

<h2>What do we already know?</h2>

<p>Below are references for some local, regional and national reports that use data on early care and education. </p>

<h2>Sample results</h2>

<h3>Enrollment in pre-K programs</h3>

<p>The following results review data on pre-K experience and subsidized childcare and early childhood education slots from the various sources available. </p>

<p>First, SDE provides data on the pre-K experience of students that enroll in kindergarten in the state. </p>

<p>Aggregated data for the 30-town CRCOG region shows that roughly 75 percent of students enrolling in kindergarten have had some form of pre-K experience for the past few years. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1"> </p>

<p>Segmenting districts, the rates of pre-K experience are lower in the eight Alliance Districts, fluctuating between 50 to 75 percent, while higher-performing districts have had rates closer to 85 percent.</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2"> </p>

<p>Most districts have fairly stable rates, although there are large year-on-year fluctuations in the SDE data for Hartford Public Schools and declining rates in some other districts. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3"> </p>

<p>For the last five years, Tolland Public Schools have the lowest rates of students with pre-K experience in the region, perhaps surprising given that it is among the higher-performing districts and more affluent towns in the region. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4"> </p>

<p>While towns like Tolland are outliers, if we compare median household income and rates of pre-K experience, the general trend is still for higher rates of pre-K experience in higher income towns.</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-5.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5"> </p>

<p>The second primary data source on early education is the American Community Survey. The ACS includes data on school enrollment (public and private), <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_B14003&amp;prodType=table">segmented by age, gender and other variables</a>. </p>

<p>The map below shows the percent of 3-4 year olds that are enrolled in public and private school programs, by town, for the five-year 2007 - 2011 period.</p>

<pre><code>Error: cannot open the connection
</code></pre>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-6.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6"> </p>

<p>ACS results differ from the SDE data. Tolland (for instance) has one of the highest rates in the ACS data, and Hartford is closer to the middle of the pack. According to the ACS data, urban periphery towns like East Hartford, Enfield and Bloomfield have the lowest rates of enrollment in the region.</p>

<p>Since the data is drawn from the ACS, there are also margins of error associated with the values, which can be large for small towns.  </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-7.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7"> </p>

<p>Direct comparison shows where 5-year average rates from ACS and SDE agree and disagree.  Each measures slightly different things - the ACS data measures the number of 3 - 4 year olds living in these towns that attend school. The SDE data measures the number of children attending kindergarten in the respective school districts that have some prior pre-kindergarten experience. </p>

<p>Which data source does a better job identifying the important issues for our region? </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-8.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8"> </p>

<h3>Subsidies for pre-K programs</h3>

<p>The next set of indicators are on subsidies for pre-K and other childcare programs. </p>

<p>SDE publishes data on publicly-funded pre-K slots. Not all towns have available slots, but for those with slots, Bloomfield has the highest rate relative to the size of the 3 - 4 year-old population in the region. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-9.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9"> </p>

<p>The publicly-funded childcare slots are also available by funding source and with several demographic breakouts. </p>

<p>Care 4 Kids data is also available in <a href="http://www.cahs.org/pdf/CAHS2013-KIDSCOUNT-ALLPGS-SINGLES.pdf">the most recent KidsCount report</a>. The report notes that there are &#39;no surprises&#39; - urban centers have higher enrollment, although some inner-ring suburbs also have high enrollment rates. </p>

<p>In this case, Hartford has the highest rate in the region, followed by Bloomfield and East Hartford where the average number enrolled is more than half of all 3 - 4 year olds living in the town. </p>
